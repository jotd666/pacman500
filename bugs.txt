The last thing to mention about the ghost house is how to determine whether a ghost will move right or left after exiting the home.
Ghosts typically move to the left once they get outside, but if the system changes modes one or more times when a ghost is inside,
that ghost will move to the right instead of the left upon leaving the house.
