bugs:

- sometimes pac too fast when taking power pill at some point.
- sometimes all pills taken but no level end
- pac leaving a few pixels behind
- ghosts show where they're going too late (missing one tile?)
- fruit/ready not reset when life is lost
- 2 cyan ghosts at some point because of score color 200+400? always reset ghost palettes after score display
- test / display ghosts targets with extra sprite (except red)
- cookie cut for bonuses ou autre solution???
- in the end infinite scatter for all ghosts: should be fixed
- remove bonus doesn't work well
- score for bonus doesn't disappear: ??? pas vrai? random?

random bugs:

- pacman corruption left/upper
- to right: pacman trashed mem corruption???
- score goes berzerk

todo:

- end of level: clear screen (pacman pos)
- black tunnel mask OR sprite shifter
- leave pen behaviour after a life is lost
- elroy behaviour after a life is lost
- intermission sequences
- sound
- cheat keys! levelskip, add 1 life, invincible
- restart after game over
