bugs:

- pac leaving a few pixels behind
- pt player sample play issues: yes but covered by sound loop!!
- pacman super speed sometimes: flash when speed is 2 several times in a row
- demo mode (record input not replaying properly!!)
- pacman traverses ghosts sometimes
- check clyde target sometimes upper left WTF!!
- .compute_player_speed: call only when a move must be made
- eye-return sound loop not correct

todo:

- leave pen behaviour after a life is lost: coded, but wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- elroy behaviour after a life is lost: coded!!
- intermission level 2: longer so the music can end
- intermission sequences:
  * 3"20 (after level 2): ghost chases pacman, big pacman chases back
  * 7"50 (after level 5): ghost chases pacman, tears his drape on a nail
  * 13"00 (after level 9): ghost chases pacman with repaired drape, but returns almost naked
  * 18"00 (after level 13): same as before
