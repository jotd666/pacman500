bugs:

- inky trapped in pen in the end of level (lose life, capture ghosts)
- 0-time power pill: ghosts locked ? don't change direction
- check fright timer for higher levels
- pacman traverses ghosts sometimes

minor issues:

- some loops not correct (bad loop timing now that we went 50hz)
- reset "frightened" palette to blue (for intro)
- pt player sample play issues: yes but covered by sound loop!!
- demo mode (record input not replaying properly!!)
- after game over: intro text shifted (draw timer vs update timer bug!!!)
- pac leaving a few pixels behind


reported, not reproduced:

- 'Game Over' text staying up even when playing
- I also had to downgrade to OCS display in the Boot Menu as AGA gave corrupted graphics


todo:

- sequence to enable cheat keys
- highscore save
- quit with F10 instead of LMB
- intermission sequences:
  * 3"20 (after level 2): ghost chases pacman, big pacman chases back => DONE
  * 7"50 (after level 5): ghost chases pacman, tears his drape on a nail
  * 13"00 (after level 9): ghost chases pacman with repaired drape, but returns almost naked
  * 18"00 (after level 13): same as before
