bugs:

- pac leaving a few pixels behind
- pt player sample play issues: yes but covered by sound loop!!
- pacman super speed sometimes: flash when speed is 2 several times in a row: level 3 happens!!
- demo mode (record input not replaying properly!!)
- pacman traverses ghosts sometimes
- check clyde target sometimes upper left WTF!! add debug
- .compute_player_speed: call only when a move must be made
- eye-return sound loop not correct
- there is the obvious 'Game Over' text staying up even when playing: not reproduced
- I also had to downgrade to OCS display in the Boot Menu as AGA gave corrupted graphics: not reproduced
- game over: intro text shifted (draw timer vs update timer bug!!!)

todo:

- intermission sequences:
  * 3"20 (after level 2): ghost chases pacman, big pacman chases back => DONE
  * 7"50 (after level 5): ghost chases pacman, tears his drape on a nail
  * 13"00 (after level 9): ghost chases pacman with repaired drape, but returns almost naked
  * 18"00 (after level 13): same as before
